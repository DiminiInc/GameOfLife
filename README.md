The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The universe of the Game of Life is an two-dimensional orthogonal grid, where top side is connected to bottom side and left side is connected to right side, of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

-Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies

-Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives

-Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies

-Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
